This file is meant to be used to create and populate the database "Hotel", referring to the project for Basi di Dati made by Cristian Gabbi and Giorgio Martino.

The following procedure is tested on PgAdmin III

Step 1: Create a new DataBase.
- open PgAdmin
- create a new DataBase
- insert a name (ex. "Hotel")
- press OK

Step 2: Create all the tables, triggers, domains and views. Populate the DataBase with some data.
- click on the project name and open the SQL window 
- open the "hotel.sql" file given in the same archive of this file 
- copy and paste all the content from "hotel.sql" into the PgAdmin's SQL window
- click on the "execute query" button
- if everything went right a message like this will be displayed:
	"Query returned successfully: one row affected, 106 msec execution time."

Now you are able to navigate the DataBase. In the "query.sql" file there are some queries to interact with the DataBase. Just copy and paste one of them and try to execute.
